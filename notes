NAVIGATION

We usually use navigation.navigate('passing the route' or {routeName: 'passing the route'})

We can also use navigation.push('routeName'). This helps us navigate further in the same screen. Like in Cpanel file directory, same screen but we can travel to different folders and files.

popToTop() method to go all the way to the first item in the stack.
replace() method to replace the current item at the top of the stack. we can't go back because the screen was replaced not pushed.
